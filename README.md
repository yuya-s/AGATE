# AGATE

## Datasets
We created graph data from three datasets; [NBA](https://www.basketball-reference.com), [Reddit](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html), and [AMiner](https://www.aminer.cn/citation).  
Time-evolving attributed graphs for AGATE can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LM5_fOi__hHCpRAXJjTi445tTRYhRsNY?usp=sharing).  
Unzip graph.zip and place it under [DATASET]/data/ to run it.

## Codes
You can find source code that works with each dataset in the AMiner, NBA, and Reddit.  
You can run AGATE by run.sh  
All hyperparameters are described in setting_param.py.  
MakeSample has codes that create a dataset for a sub-prediction task.  
Model has codes for training methods of each subprediction task.  
Evaluation has codes for evaluating subprediction accuracy.
